# COVID-19 Policies

## Student health

If you are sick, stay home. If you feel you *might* be sick, stay home.
No matter what you think you may be sick with (cold, flu, food poisoning, COVID, *anything*),
just stay home. Do not come to class if you have COVID symptoms, have recently tested positive
for COVID, or are required to quarantine. **Stay home**.

**Seriously. STAY HOME. You won't miss anything.**

I will be posting recorded lectures to the Canvas page.

All of your assignments can be completed remotely.

I will drop your lowest worksheet and tutorial grade at the end of the semester.

I will make alternate arrangements for those who are ill right before/during quizzes
(either reweight grades, offer an alternate quiz time, etc.). 
Please fill out an academic concession form (may be found on the Canvas page) and email
it to me in advance of the quiz. 
Per UBC policy, students who miss the final quiz must apply for deferred standing.

**You are required to perform a daily self-health assessment before attending campus**. Every day,
before coming to class, complete the self-assessment for Covid symptoms using
[this tool](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en).

**You can check [this website](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who) to find
out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor.**

Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. 

## Seating in class
To reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, please **sit in the same seat/area in the classroom each day**. 
This will minimize your contacts. 

## Interacting with Instructors
**Do not approach the front of the classroom under any circumstances.** 
In order to minimize contact, the teaching team will remain at the front of the classroom,
and students will remain in the seating area. 
You are welcome to raise your hand to ask questions while I lecture as usual.
We will offer *assistance-at-a-distance (TM)* on your in-class assignments via Zoom with screen sharing.

## Masks
**Masks are required for all indoor classes** (per the BC Public Health Officer
orders). A mask is a medical or non-medical device that covers *both* the nose and mouth.
You must wear the mask for the full duration of in-class meetings.
Please do not eat in class; if you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc, please keep your mask
on between sips. You may be asked to remove your mask briefly on occasion 
(e.g., for an exam ID check), but otherwise, your mask should remain on.

## Vaccination
COVID-19 vaccines are available to you, free, and on campus. 
See the [Vancouver Coastal Health page](http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine). 
The higher the rate of
vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading the
virus. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so. 

## Instructor health
**If I (Trevor, the instructor) become ill:** I will not attend the in-person class. If I am well enough to continue teaching,
I will run the class remotely on Zoom. If I am not well enough to teach, I will find a substitute instructor
who will run the class either in-person or online. You will be notified in advance as early as possible what the 
plan is.

**If a TA becomes ill:** they will not attend class.
If they are able to continue their duties remotely, they will do so.
If they are not, either another TA will fill in for them, or their work
will be postponed until they are well.
